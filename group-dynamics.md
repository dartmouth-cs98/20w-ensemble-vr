## I. Communication
*You are required to spend at least 10 hours/week outside of class. Outline a general weekly meeting schedule with at least 1 time that everybody can make. That one meeting must include the entire team in the same room, in person. The rest of the 10 hours may be split into several sessions throughout the week. A nice tool for this is [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).*

### Schedule
* LSC 200 at 3:30 on Mondays
* LSC 200 at 4:30 on Thursdays
* Novack at 7PM-9PM on Wednesday
* FoCo at 10AM-3PM on Saturday

### Responsiveness
*How often should team members be expected to check and respond on Slack?*
* At least once a day


## II. Decision Making

### Group
*What types of decisions need to be discussed and approved by the entire group?*
* Delegating work
* Design choices
* Git pushes and pulls

### Individual
*What types of decisions can be made by a single person?*
* Implementation for their component

## III. Conflict Resolution
There are three main types of conflict that tend to occur in group projects:

* **Creative differences**: disagreement on any decisions related to the product
* **Personal differences**: friction between people due to manner or words said
* **Ghosting**: consistent missed deadlines or lack of contribution

Your group should decide on a plan of action to deal with each type of conflict. There can be multiple levels to each plan. Involving the instructors (Tim or Kate) can be part of the plan.

Try to be as specific as possible. 
* A bad plan for Ghosting: “Talk to the person.” (too vague)
* A better plan for Ghosting: “Elect the team member who is closest with that person to check in with them one-on-one. Based on the conversation, reexamine the tasks currently on that person’s plate and revise if necessary. Affirm that they are coming to the next team meeting. At the next team meeting, every team member will make an effort to include the Ghoster in any team discussions.”


### Course of Action
*What will your group do in order to resolve each type of conflict? (include the levels of escalation)*

* Ghosting: Have the person closest to them reach out. Maybe reorganize responsibilities for that person. At any meeting thereafter, make sure to engage all members of the group.

* Creative: Have a team meeting so that everyone, not just the people having disagreements, can be part of the discussion in deciding the best possible design for the team

* Personal: If too personal, reach out to Tim for conflict mediation. Otherwise, the two in conflict should meet one-on-one to clear up any misunderstandings/issues.

The End!
