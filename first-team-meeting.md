## Team Members Present

* Soohwan Park
* Marshall Peng
* Ryan Hyun
* James Lee
* Bryan Shin
* Myles Holt


## I. Identify a Common Vision
*You’ve all voted on a common idea and themes. Now is the time to work through your commonalities and find a unifying vision between all of you. Answer the following for each of you.  This is the time to speak your mind.  Be honest with each other.*

### Commonalities
*Who makes up your team?  What are some common things you are interested in? Tell each other about the things you put down on the survey and expand on some of your passions.*
* We all share a passion for music.
* We're all interested in making a real impact on the world, rather than simply improving people's quality of life.
* We appreciate the power of VR.
* We have an interest in helping people with disabilities

### Inspiration
*What are some things each of you is inspired by?*
* The Power of Music
* The Universality of Music
* Impactful visual design/aesthetics
* Medicine, healthcare
* Helping those with disabilities
* Technological innovations in consumer products

### Problems of Interest
*What problems are you looking to address? Why?*
* Most musicians do not have the means to practice with an orchestra or an accompaniment. They also do not have enough experience on stage and have not enough means to combat stage fright.
* Most people do not know how much water they are consuming throughout the day and how much they should be consuming, which depends on a variety of factors such as the caffeine and alcohol intake. 
* Pianos are crazy expensive, heavy, and large. Thus, many people cannot afford to keep one in their homes.
* Since childhood, people develop bad posture which influence them throughout the rest of their lives, which is highly correlated with several disorders.

### Identify
*Which of the above is most interesting to all of you?*
* Most musicians do not have the means to practice with an orchestra or an accompaniment. This project aims to make a realistic performance in front of a full audience convenient for anyone. Lots of musicians also do not have enough experience on stage, hence often times have stage fright. 



## II. Narrow In
*Now let's try narrowing in on a problem that interests all of you. Make sure to go around the table and listen to everybody on your team without interruption.*

### Problem Statement
*State the problem you want to solve succinctly.*
* Many musicians never experience a fully organized performance with accompiment and audience.

### Rephrase
*Try to rephrase the problem statement (negative) as an opportunity (positive). Word it as a question beginning with, “How might we…?”*
* How might we help musicians learn what it feels like to perform live?

### Reframe
*Reframe the question in at least 5 different ways to change the question fundamentally or imply a different solution set.  Try changing scope, or audience, or technology.*

1. How might we help musicians become better adjusted to stage?
2. How might we help beginner musicians become better adjusted to performing in a professional setting?
3. What kinds of virtual audience and accompaniment can we provide beginner musicians with?
4. What technologies can we use to help alleviate musicians' stage fright?
5. How can we create a faithful representation of a live concert performance for an individual musician?

### Choose
*Are any of the reframes more interesting?  Choose one.*
1. What kinds of virtual audience and accompaniment can we provide beginner musicians with?


#### Coolness
*What could be cool about this potential project?*
* Designing our own Virtual Reality environment
* Real-time score following
* Physics of Sound
* Sound Design

#### Challenges
*What could be challenging / unfun about this potential project?*
* Having the ai immediately recognize the location in the score
* Balancing the sounds the musician hears from his/her own instrument and from the VR accompaniment
* Designing a realistic concert hall in VR
* Having the accompaniment play in-sync with the musician

#### Success
*What does success look like for this project?*
* Success for this project looks like a Virtual Reality environment that simiulates real-time accompaniment with reliable tracking to a player's instrumentation.



## III. Survey the State of the Art
*Do some research — this will be fleshed out further in a full milestone but do some now quickly all together to get started. Try to find what else is out there that is similar, either products, or technical papers that are related.*

### Similar Goals
*Are there others working to achieve similar goals?*

* There are researchers working on the problem of score following using reinforcement learning. For example, https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06391
* There exists an app, called Cadenza that also provides accompaniment that attempts to follow the musician.

### Differences
*How is your approach different/better than the state of the art?*
* Current approaches do not create a realistic and immersive experience.
* We have added features such as having this in VR, which gives a more realistic experience.
* We will try to implement other features such as uploading your own midi files, composing your own music, etc.

### Inspiration
*Are there any existing products/techniques/research, that we could, by analogy, draw inspiration from?*
